Project 4&5- Udacity : Data Visualization Nanodegree

Project 4 - Data Storytelling course midterm project
In this project, students will apply the skills they’ve learned in structuring a data story. They will be provided with a Movies Metadata CSV and will have the ability to define their own problem statement, the analyses they’d conduct to solve the objective, and outline a set of potential solutions/actionable next steps for their target audience.

Project 5 - Data Storytelling course final project
In this project, students will understand how to identify the limitations and biases in data that affect the recommendations they provide to their management team. In addition, they’ll put it all together by combining their ghost deck and their analyses to provide a final recommendation. Students will use the same Movies Metadata CSV and conduct the EDA necessary to understand the dataset as a whole. The expected output from students will be to surface if the dataset is balanced, if there are anomalies in the dataset that affect the applicability of the recommendation, and the final presentation itself that will be used for a mock recommendation to a management team.
